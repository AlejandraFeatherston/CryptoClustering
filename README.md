I used the following code to be able to use hvplot on google colab. It was posted on Slack by a classmate: https://colab.research.google.com/github/holoviz-community/HoloViz_KDD2022/blob/main/02_Plotting.ipynb?authuser=1#scrollTo=2a114743
I referenced class activities to complete the assignment as well
